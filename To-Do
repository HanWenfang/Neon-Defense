To-Do List:
===========
Towers:
1) Aim at enemies in range.
2) Fire projectiles.
3) Add upgrade images.
4) Make better base images.
5) Create other towers once the first one is working.

Enemies:
1) Finish Enemy class.
2) Create images for enemies
3) Create movement algorithm.

Field:
1) Create a better connection between the Tile and Tower classes.

GUI:
1) Shop bar needs the costs of the towers.
2) Upgrade bar needs to come up when a tower is selected.

Random Thoughts:
- The enemies should just be basic shapes. This is a complete turnaround from my original idea.
- Enemies should have a 1-tile memory. Then they can easily determine which direction to move.
- Enemies should explode on death.
- Enemies need a bounty. Should this bounty increase as the game moves on?
- Enemies should get harder the higher up the level chain we go. How should this work? (More health? More enemies?)
